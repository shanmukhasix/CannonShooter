CannonShooter is a simple python (Python3) game I made while learing pygame (v1.9.6).

It contains a cannon and flying enemies (mosqutioes). Score will be increased everytime a mosquito is killed. If a mosquito manages to pass over the cannon it will lead to Game Over.

## Requirements:

1. First make sure you have python installed in your computer. You can get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Since this game uses modules from pygame, you need to download pygame module from pip. For Windows, just copy paste below line in command prompt  
>pip install pygame
3.
